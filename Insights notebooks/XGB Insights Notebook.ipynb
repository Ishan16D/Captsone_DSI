force beh Print Email http humansarefree com 2016 11 billionaire globalist soros exposed a html Billionaire globalist financier George Soros MoveOn org ha been revealed to be a driving force behind the organizing of nationwide protest against the election of Donald Trump exposing the protest to largely be an organized top down operation and not an organic movement of concerned Americans taking to the street a reported by the mainstream medium Wednesday saw protest in the street of at least 10 major U S city Chicago New York Los Angeles Philadelphia Boston Washington D C Portland Ore St Paul Minn Seattle and several other city saw protest according to USA Today In light of the protest and rioting that have transpired since the election of Trump a closer analysis of the dynamic at play is warranted to gauge whether it s an organic grassroots movement or something much more organized sophisticated and potentially dangerous Soros affiliated organization MoveOn org released the following press release yesterday afternoon Americans to Come Together in Hundreds Peaceful Gatherings of Solidarity Resistance and Resolve Following Election Results Hundreds of Americans dozen of organization to gather peacefully outside the White House and in city and town nationwide to take a continued stand against misogyny racism Islamophobia and xenophobia Tonight thousand of Americans will come together at hundred of peaceful gathering in city and town across the nation including outside the White House following the result of Tuesday s presidential election The gathering organized by MoveOn org and ally will affirm a continued rejection of Donald Trump s bigotry xenophobia Islamophobia and misogyny and demonstrate our resolve to fight together for the America we still believe is possible Within two hour of the call to action MoveOn member had created more than 200 gathering nationwide with the number continuing to grow on Wednesday afternoon Now come report from various protest location that reveal a substantially coordinated effort and not the organic grassroots showing by concerned Americans a the mainstream medium is reporting Photos from Austin Texas reveal a line of bus the protestors arrived in making their appearance seem substantially le than organic with a direct implication of being strategically orchestrated Anti Trump protestors in Austin today are not a organic a they seem Here are the bus they came in fakeprotests trump2016 austin pic twitter com VxhP7t6OUI erictucker erictucker November 10 2016 With evidence mounting the question must be asked is George Soros working through his front organization to foment an American revolution BeshoyBadie desjax erictucker Pretty evident that the sign were printed by Soros and Creamer group IIRC Soros linked w MB Huma pic twitter com KgXvIQr2b8 MEGATRON MEGATRONs_SMIRK November 10 2016 Note that the group is actively organizing protest to a democratic election that no one is contesting the legitimacy of in term of whether the vote wa rigged etc Essentially they are displeased with the result and are calling for people to rise up and not accept the result For an organization that feigns to promote democracy their action speak otherwise This is a disaster We fought our heart out to avert this reality But now it s here MoveOn org staff wrote to member on Wednesday The new president elect and many of his most prominent supporter have targeted demeaned and threatened million of u and million of our friend family and loved one Both chamber of Congress remain in Republican hand We are entering an era of profound and unprecedented challenge a time of danger for our community and our country In this moment we have to take care of ourselves our family and our friend especially those of u who are on the front line facing hate including Latinos woman immigrant refugee Black people Muslims LGBT Americans and so many others And we need to make it clear that we will continue to stand together Perhaps the most absurd part of the protest is that President elect Trump hasn t made a single policy decision yet and in fact the entire section of his website regarding banning Muslims wa scrubbed shortly after his election This denotes that anything said during the campaign wa most likely simple election campaign rhetoric and subsequent framing of said rhetoric by the opposition The left wing organization is one of a number of progressive organization affiliated with Soros Open Society Foundation Soros affiliated organization across the world are deeply connected to various color revolution the Arab Spring and a number of other political uprising across the globe According to a report in New Eastern Outlook The totality of what is revealed in the three hacked document show that Soros is effectively the puppet master pulling most of the string in Kiev Soros Foundation s Ukraine branch International Renaissance Foundation IRF ha been involved in Ukraine since 1989 His IRF doled out more than 100 million to Ukrainian NGOs two year before the fall of the Soviet Union creating the precondition for Ukraine s independence from Russia in 1991 Soros also admitted to financing the 2013 2014 Maidan Square protest that brought the current government into power Soros foundation were also deeply involved in the 2004 Orange Revolution that brought the corrupt but pro NATO Viktor Yushchenko into power with his American wife who had been in the US State Department In 2004 just week after Soros International Renaissance Foundation had succeeded in getting Viktor Yushchenko a President of Ukraine Michael McFaul wrote an OpEd for the Washington Post McFaul a specialist in organizing color revolution who later became US Ambassador to Russia revealed Did Americans meddle in the internal affair of Ukraine Yes The American agent of influence would prefer different language to describe their activity democratic assistance democracy promotion civil society support etc but their work however labeled seek to influence political change in Ukraine Anyone familiar with the history of the Soros Open Society Foundations in Eastern Europe and around the world since the late 1980 s will know that his supposedly philanthropic democracy building project in Poland Russia or Ukraine in the 1990 s allowed Soros the businessman to literally plunder the former communist country wealth according to the New Eastern Outlook During the 2016 presidential cycle Soros committed 25 million dollar to the 2016 campaign of Hillary Clinton Per the standard Clinton operating procedure this wa indicative of the symbiotic relationship of favor between the billionaire and his array of political puppet across the globe As a testament to the power wielded by Soros contained within WikiLeaks recent release of hacked DNC email is a message from billionaire globalist financier George Soros to Hillary Clinton while she wa U S Secretary of State that clearly reveals Clinton a a Soros puppet Found within the WikiLeaks Hillary Clinton email archive is an email with the subject Unrest in Albania in which Soros make clear to Clinton that two thing need to be done urgently The Clinton Podesta Email Scandal is All About SATANISM and Pedophilia Sacrificing a Chicken to Moloch He then directs the Secretary of State to bring the full weight of the international community to bear on Prime Minister Berisha and appoint a senior European official a mediator Revealing the influence he wields within the corridor of power Soros then provides Secretary of State Clinton with three name from which to choose Unsurprisingly Clinton acquiesced and chose one of the official recommended by Soros Miroslav Lajcak Make no mistake that the event you re seeing transpire nationwide are being orchestrated in part by a billionaire political elite class that is looking to subvert the will of the American people by attempting to foment a new American
