    "sample_article = \"ATFORD, England — President Trump, who has demeaned his domestic political rivals for being laughed at around the world, found himself the scorned child on the global playground at a NATO summit here Wednesday, as widely circulated video showed leaders gossiping about and mocking him. The video, captured at a Buckingham Palace reception Tuesday evening, appeared to show Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and others laughing about Trump’s freewheeling news conferences earlier in the day. “I just watched his team’s jaws drop to the floor,” Trudeau told the others, dropping his hand toward the ground to dramatize his retelling. And so it was Wednesday morning that Trump presented a sulking, brooding president, as he slapped down Trudeau as “two-faced” and engaged with other foreign counterparts at a secluded estate here outside London. As the summit concluded, Trump abruptly canceled a planned news conference, saying that he had already answered so many questions from reporters in other settings during his visit to Britain. He took off for Washington as the House Judiciary Committee’s impeachment hearing was underway. As impeachment inquiry rages at home, Trump unsettles the world stage at NATO. Though his conduct here fit his pattern of disruption at international summits, Trump did not make the fiery threats that have punctuated previous gatherings. NATO leaders were almost giddy as they survived another encounter with Trump with their alliance intact. Trump’s canceled news conference — eliminating one last chance for him to take aim at them — was to many the departure gift. The day’s drama centered on Trump and Trudeau, who previously feuded at the Group of Seven summit in 2018. Asked Wednesday by journalists about Trudeau’s mockery, Trump fired back at the Canadian prime minister. Well, hes two-faced, Trump said of Trudeau. And honestly, with Trudeau, he’s a nice guy. I find him to be a very nice guy. But, you know, the truth is that I called him out on the fact that hes not paying 2 percent, and I guess hes not very happy about it.”\""

       "'ATFORD England President Trump who has demeaned his domestic political rivals for being laughed at around the world found himself the scorned child on the global playground at a NATO summit here Wednesday as widely circulated video showed leaders gossiping about and mocking him The video captured at a Buckingham Palace reception Tuesday evening appeared to show Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau French President Emmanuel Macron British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and others laughing about Trump s freewheeling news conferences earlier in the day I just watched his team s jaws drop to the floor Trudeau told the others dropping his hand toward the ground to dramatize his retelling And so it was Wednesday morning that Trump presented a sulking brooding president as he slapped down Trudeau as two faced and engaged with other foreign counterparts at a secluded estate here outside London As the summit concluded Trump abruptly canceled a planned news conference saying that he had already answered so many questions from reporters in other settings during his visit to Britain He took off for Washington as the House Judiciary Committee s impeachment hearing was underway As impeachment inquiry rages at home Trump unsettles the world stage at NATO Though his conduct here fit his pattern of disruption at international summits Trump did not make the fiery threats that have punctuated previous gatherings NATO leaders were almost giddy as they survived another encounter with Trump with their alliance intact Trump s canceled news conference eliminating one last chance for him to take aim at them was to many the departure gift The day s drama centered on Trump and Trudeau who previously feuded at the Group of Seven summit in 2018 Asked Wednesday by journalists about Trudeau s mockery Trump fired back at the Canadian prime minister Well hes two faced Trump said of Trudeau And honestly with Trudeau he s a nice guy I find him to be a very nice guy But you know the truth is that I called him out on the fact that hes not paying 2 percent and I guess hes not very happy about it'"
