# Fake news detection with natural language processing

## Problem Statement

Can we classify news articles by credibility using natural language processing and classification algorithms.

Fake news detection is a hot issue in NLP and media discourse. There is so much content being created online and it is difficult to vet what is true and what is fake. Media literacy should be improved but machine learning algorithms can shoulder some of the responsibility.

If it is possible to detect falsehoods using the text in an article then these models can be incredibly valuable to people care about the content they are taking in.

## Executive Summary

### Goals

The primary goal of this process was to build a classification model that could take in processed news text and output a probability of an article being fake. The label probability was the most important part of the model, as I do not want to just apply a label but rather something more nuanced. To evaluate the model, the goal was to have a strong F1 score and recall, since the most important thing for the model is to be efficient at catching all of the positive class (fake news).

A secondary goal of the project is to explore natural language processing and find the most effective ways of encoding the meaning of text in news articles.
